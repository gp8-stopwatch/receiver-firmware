# Accuracy
* [ ] Make sure fw is compiled with -O3 (trigger algorithm)
* [ ] Make unit-tests possible. GPIO external trigger.
  * [ ] Make USB output with 1m resolution - for trigger testing.
* [ ] Use TXCO obviously. Pick one and change the footprint.


# GUI 
* [ ] On screen menu
  * [ ] Brightness (?)
  * [ ] 1 or 2 participants
  * [ ] Loop mode / normal
* [ ] USB menu should include all what on-display provides plus:
  * Date / time
  * Results

# Other
* [ ] Settings memory (screen flip & sound on/off should be persisted)
* [ ] USB firmware upgrade
  * [ ] Test
  * [ ] Document

# Infrastructure
* [ ] Clean the code
  * [ ] Code should be self-contained. Everything needed for building should be included.
* [x] Remove this "big" display project for now.
* [ ] Prepare and commit other projects
* [ ] Release FW as opensource.
* [ ] Prepare a web page with documentation.
